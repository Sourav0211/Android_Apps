Java Android Apps Showcase Repository
Welcome to the Java Android Apps Showcase repository! This repository houses a collection of Android applications built using Java that showcase various fundamental concepts such as RecyclerViews, Firebase integration, API calls, JSON formatting, fragments, and more. Below is a brief overview of each app included in this repository:

1. RecyclerViewDemo
This app demonstrates the implementation of RecyclerView, a powerful UI component for displaying large sets of data efficiently in an Android app. It includes features like item click listeners, custom adapters, and various layout managers.

2. FirebaseIntegration
FirebaseIntegration showcases the integration of Firebase services into an Android application. It covers authentication, real-time database operations, and cloud messaging. Firebase is a comprehensive platform provided by Google for building mobile and web applications.
